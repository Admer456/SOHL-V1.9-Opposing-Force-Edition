<p><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">Creating a 
new sprite</span></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">To create a 
new sprite, you must use File-&gt;New sprite (Ctrl+N) After you click it, the 
Wizard window will pop-up. From that point you can create sprite in two ways:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">1) From 
scratch - you must have ready a collection of bitmaps <br>
2) from .qc file - you must decompile a sprite in order to get a collection of 
bitmaps and .qc file, or you can always make that by yourself </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">Next stage - 
adding bitmaps to your sprite file. You'll see here a list with the buttons: 
Add/Remove/Up/Down/Sort near it. If you selected the 1st option in the first 
wizard’s page, the list will be clear and you must add bitmaps to it (Add 
button). If you selected option 2, the list will be filled with paths to 
bitmaps, all that information will be parsed from .qc file. Adding frames to 
that list is very easy, you can select multiple files in select dialog, then 
sort all them in list. Also you can select multiple items in bitmaps list in 
order to move down/up or remove. Remember that bitmaps order is very important, 
because sprite frames will be compiled in that order. Now you can press the next 
button and you'll be prompted to select the output sprite name in the Save 
dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">The next 
wizard window will allow you to change the sprite's transparency mode and sprite 
type if needed. Detailed information about transparency kinds can be read 
directly on the wizard’s page. When you finish, pres Next to proceed to the next 
stage.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">This is the 
final page before sprite compilation. Here you can see a text box with 
information about the sprite. Here you can view all your settings and if 
something is wrong you can go back to the previous set-up stages. Also you'll 
see Sprite Explorers statistic on errors checking. If any problems are found 
they can be read here. Warnings can be of several kind - for example the image's 
dimensions are not multiples of 8 or they are bigger then 256 pixels. The sprite 
will be compiled even with these warnings, but in Half-Life there is some 
possibility of problems. When you are ready - click Next and your sprite will be 
compiled. That wasn’t too hard was it?&nbsp; ;-)</span></p>
